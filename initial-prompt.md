# Local Launch Dashboard â€“ Project Plan

This dashboard app will be built using **exactly the same stack and project structure** as `/Library/WebServer/Documents/09-projects-ehy/digital-micro-products`. This includes Node.js, Express.js backend, Vite frontend tooling, and any shared libraries or conventions. This ensures maximum consistency, code reuse, and easier maintenance between your projects.

## Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Set up project repo** in `/Library/WebServer/Documents/00-local-sites/local-launch-dashboard`
2. **Initialize Node.js project** (matching digital-micro-products: package.json, git, etc.)
3. **Scaffold backend** using Express.js, following the same structure and conventions as digital-micro-products
4. **Scaffold frontend** using Vite and the same frontend stack as digital-micro-products
5. **Implement endpoints** for server management (launch/stop/status) and resource monitoring (CPU, memory, etc.)
6. **Build dashboard UI** with the same design system/components as digital-micro-products
7. **Integrate backend and frontend** for seamless UX
8. **Test dashboard functionality** thoroughly (launch/stop servers, status updates, resource info)
9. **Set local webserver entry point** to dashboard app's index
10. **(Optional)** Add auto-start on boot and persistent status tracking

## Todo List

- [ ] Set up project repo in /Library/WebServer/Documents/00-local-sites/local-launch-dashboard
- [ ] Initialize Node.js project (matching digital-micro-products)
- [ ] Scaffold backend (Express.js, endpoints, process management, same structure)
- [ ] Scaffold frontend (Vite, dashboard UI, same stack/design)
- [ ] Implement server launch/stop/status endpoints
- [ ] Display server load and memory usage in dashboard
- [ ] Integrate backend and frontend
- [ ] Test dashboard functionality
- [ ] Set local webserver entry point to dashboard app's index
- [ ] (Optional) Add auto-start on boot and persistent status tracking

**All architectural, design, and implementation decisions should mirror the digital-micro-products project for maximum compatibility and maintainability.**
