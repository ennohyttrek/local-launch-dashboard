# IMPORTANT: Read META-AGENTS.md First

Before any work on this project, agents must read:
`/Library/WebServer/Documents/01-orga/ai-meta-instructions/META-AGENTS.md`

## Key Reminders for This Project:

### Version Management
- **style.css** is the primary version source (WordPress-style header)
- All version files must be kept in sync: style.css, README.md, CHANGELOG.md, package.json
- Never commit without explicit developer approval
- Wait for blue button approval before any Git operations

### Project Planning Files
- **NEXTSTEPS.md** contains only immediately actionable tasks (one developer day max)
- **ROADMAP.md** contains strategic direction and longer-term features
- Always read both at session start - they may have been manually edited

### Current Version: 0.0.4
All files are synchronized to version 0.0.4 as of the pending commit.
